_it's a new blog!_

## how did it get to this?

I was recently asked to investigate the popular blogging platform Medium.com.

Medium.com provides a relatively simple means for anyone to set up a blog.

You sign up (with an email, Google account, or Twitter ID) for no money down,
create a _publication_ and start writing.

_Publications_ are collections of posts. Blogs.

You can also allow other Medium users to contribute to your publication as
_writers_ or _editors_

All content is served up on the Medium.com domain.

### No more custom domains on Medium.com

early 2017 a US$75 surcharge was added to what was previously a _free_ feature
