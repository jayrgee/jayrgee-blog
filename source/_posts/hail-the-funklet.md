## 2012

> One of the best Kickstarter projects I contributed towards in 2011 ... was Jack Stratton’s [“Funklet: Graphic notations of twenty classic funk beats.”](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1461914303/the-funklet?ref=users)
>
> While the Funklet is now out of print, Stratton has encouraged his backers to pass around the [PDF version](http://web.archive.org/web/20140813170242/http://www.kempa.com/files/TheFunklet.pdf), and a website presenting interactive versions of roughly half of the beats has been launched at [Funklet.com](http://funklet.com/).

> Rob Stenson called and said we should make a website with a sequencer that plays Funklet beats.  I, in a stroke of genius, agreed.

> Behold: [funklet.com](http://funklet.com/) (in chrome)

> I could list all the features here, but that would take upwards of seven bullet points.  Browse around.  Discover!  Be your true self.  Program a beat.  Tweet it or delete it!
