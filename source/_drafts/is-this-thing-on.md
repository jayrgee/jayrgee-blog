_it's a new blog!_

## how did it get to this?

I was recently asked to investigate the popular blogging platform [Medium](https://medium.com/).

Medium provides a relatively simple means for anyone to set up a blog. You sign up (with an email, Google account, or Twitter ID) for no money down, create a _publication_ and start writing.

_Publications_ are collections of posts. Blogs.

As of November 2017 all new publications will be served up on the Medium.com domain.

## No more custom domains on Medium.com

Medium _did_ previously offer custom domains as a feature. This was originally a _free_ option later replaced by a one-off setup fee (US$75) in early 2017.

However, as of November 2017:

> _Medium is no longer offering new custom domains as a feature. If you already have a custom domain on Medium, nothing will change for you for the foreseeable future, and your domain will continue to work as expected._
