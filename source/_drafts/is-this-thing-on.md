_it's a new blog!_

## how did it get to this?

I recently spent some time attempting to get a handle on the online publishing platform [Medium](https://medium.com/) with a view to using to to establish a new blog.

Medium provides a relatively low barrier of entry to anyone wishing to start publishing online. You only have to choose how you want to sign in (via an email link, Google account, or Twitter ID) and then you can start writing. All for no money down.

If you want to collaborate with other writers under a common banner you can also create a _Publication_.

## custom domains...

Until late 2017 it was possible to configure your Medium publication to be served up on a custom domain. This is a very attractive feature to anyone publishing original content on a third party platform: You get to use this nice platform for creating content and Google will index the published content against _your_ domain.

As of November 2017 all new publications will be served up on the Medium.com domain:

> Medium is no longer offering new custom domains for publications as a feature. If you already have a custom domain on Medium, nothing will change for you for the foreseeable future, and your domain will continue to work as expected.
>
> You can always create a publication on Medium that will live on a medium.com/publication-name URL.

## no more custom domains on Medium.com

Medium _did_ previously offer custom domains as a feature. This was originally a _free_ option later replaced by a one-off setup fee (US$75) in early 2017.

However, as of November 2017:

> _Medium is no longer offering new custom domains as a feature. If you already have a custom domain on Medium, nothing will change for you for the foreseeable future, and your domain will continue to work as expected._

## why bother with a custom domain?

If you are _happy_ to give _your_ work to _somebody else_ for _nothing_ then that is fine. It's your choice, no worries.

Just as I was struggling with how to articulate why you should care, the internet comes through with this post by Kin Lane:

> ...we should never lose sight of the importance of owning, operating, and cultivating our own domain. There will always be new platforms who come along and prey upon our desire for more traffic, and the magical network effects they will bring, but it will NEVER be worth abandoning our own domain. Platforms come and go, pivot, shift courses, and rarely will think of you as more than just a data point.

## it's not all bad

Medium is fine for what is. It can actually offer pretty good value for money if you're not relying on it as the _source_ of your original content.
